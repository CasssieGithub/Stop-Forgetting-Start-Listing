The technology I used for my application were:

1. Javascript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. BootStrap
5. Node.js
6. Express
7. MongoDB/Mongoose
8. EJS

Day one of my project, I created a wire frame and broke down the process step-by-step of what I would like to accomplish. Throughout my project, I altered the wire frame to suit what I wanted. I didn't have any unsolved problems while making my project.

- Note to self in my future project, add (possibly) a login feature and a right side navigation bar to navitate while you are under the listed items (grocery list, todo list, etc.,)
